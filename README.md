# Java-Arduino-Communication-Library
Serial Communication between Java and Arduino made simple.

# Description
Serial Communication between Arduino and Java has never been simpler. A better alternative to the RXTX library, the JavaArduinoLibrary is an easy to use library with simple methods that allow you, the JAVA programmer, to read and write from the serial port. Seamless serial communication with the port of your choice. It uses the [jSerialComm library](https://github.com/Fazecast/jSerialComm)  by fazecast for serial port access. **Refer to the [instructions page](https://github.com/HirdayGupta/Java-Arduino-Communication-Library/wiki/Instructions) in the wiki for more information.** <br>
**IMPORTANT**: please download and import both JARs in the files into your project.

# Features
* Contains an arduino class whose objects can be used to communicate with the given port.<br>
* Platform-independent development ensuring uniformity across platforms. <br>
* Easy (overloaded) functions for serialRead() and serialWrite().<br>
* Overloaded constructors make it easy to make an object irrespective of scenario.<br>
* Also contains a class which will list all available serial ports for connection.<br>
* Getter and setter methods expand the use case to any scenario. <br>
* Does not require any firmware to be uploaded into the arduino beforehand. Will work out of the box.<br><br>
**IMPORTANT**: please download and import both JARs in the files into your project.
